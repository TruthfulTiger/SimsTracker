# SimsTracker

This is a personal project that I am currently working on. It uses the Fat Free Framework (F3) for the PHP backend, and jQuery / Bootstrap for the frontend. It is a game helper, specifically for players of The Sims series (currently just 2) to keep track of their sims, and even keep score of a legacy challenge (more info at https://www.simslegacychallenge.com/legacy-challenge-rules/sims-2-legacy-challenge-rules-advanced/). 

We never covered F3 in uni, so this is completely self-taught. A lot of interactive pages have been written in jQuery (with the help of extra scripts where necessary); the whole thing has been great practice :)

It is currently in demo form and is very much WIP, but is often updated and auto-uploaded to the web server. 

You can access the demo at http://simstracker.samgoacher.co.uk/ - most of the magic happens when you are logged in, so feel free to create an account and have a play :)

Because this is a personal project it is not currently well commented, but now people are showing an interest, I will work on that.
